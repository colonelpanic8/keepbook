#+TITLE: Crypto + FX Sources
#+AUTHOR:
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Scope
Implement crypto daily-close and FX daily reference sources.

* Files
- New modules under =src/market_data/providers/=.
- Each module implements =CryptoPriceSource= or =FxRateSource=.

* Crypto (CoinGecko)
- Use daily historical endpoint for a coin.
- Map =Asset::Crypto { symbol, network }= to CoinGecko IDs.
- Return =PricePoint= with =quote_currency= (usually USD) and =kind= close.
- Use UTC date for =as_of_date=.

* FX (Frankfurter / ECB)
- Frankfurter API (ECB-based) is free and stable for daily rates.
- ECB rates are EUR-based; handle conversion if base != EUR.
- Return =FxRatePoint= with =kind= close and source="frankfurter".

* Tests
- Unit tests for response parsing.
- Include sample JSON in fixtures.

* TODOs
- Decide if FX source should also support weekends/holidays fallback.
- Add mapping table for crypto symbols -> CoinGecko IDs (config or registry).
