# Contracts

Shared JSON contract fixtures that must match both the Rust and TypeScript implementations.

These fixtures are intentionally small and stable. When an output format changes, update the
fixture(s) and ensure both test suites pass:

- Rust: `cargo test`
- TypeScript: `cd ts && yarn test`
